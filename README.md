## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom utility class along with standard built-in Tailwind CSS classes.
- [React Typescript](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
- React short circuit Evaluation - I learnt how to conditionally render UI element using react's useState hook and some conditional Jsx block.
- Breaking down the functions within the hook was a challenge but once i finally noted down the underlining core actions it was fairly easygoing. Using Typescript also helped and the type checking catches so many potential bugs early



### Continued development
- Best practices for structuring complex custom hooks beyond basic state management.
- When to split functionality into multiple smaller hooks vs. keeping it in one larger hook 
- Proper dependency management in custom hooks to avoid unnecessary re-renders
